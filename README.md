# European-Bike-Sales-Dashboard
Bike Buyers Sales Dashboard from Kaggle.
I completed "Alex The Analyst," Excel portfolio project, using slicers such as, Martial Status, Geographical Region, and Education to determine whether men or women were purchasing more bicycles. During this analysis, I performed various data cleaning methods, created column and line charts, pivot tables, and ultimately an interactive dashboard for easy customer viewing.
