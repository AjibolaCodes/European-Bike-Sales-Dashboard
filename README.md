# European-Bike-Sales-Dashboard
Bike Buyers Sales Dashboard from Kaggle
I completed "Alex The Analyst," Excel portfolio project, where I used a dataset from Kaggle "Europe Bike Sale, (Bike Buyers), using slicers such as, Martial Status, Geographical Region, and Education to determine whether men or women were purchasing more bicycles. During this analysis, I performed various data cleaning methods, created column and line charts, pivot tables, and ultimately an interactive dashboard for easy customer viewing.
